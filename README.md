[Streamlit Link](https://att-ar-poisson-and-binom-distributions-calculators-wotcls.streamlitapp.com/)

Probability calculator for discrete random distributions, mainly the Poisson and Binomial distributions.

**Binomial Probability:**

$$ \binom{n}{x} p^{x} \cdot (1-p)^{n-x}$$

Where:
- n is the total number of bernouilli trials
- x is the wanted number of successful bernouilli trials
- p is the binomial probability of obtaining a success value in each bernouilli trial

**Poisson Probability:**

$$ \frac {e^{-\lambda} \cdot \lambda^x} {x!} $$

Where:
- lambda is the characteristic poisson variable
- x is the chosen variable in the random variable distribution
